    <h2>Facts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Although the Korean War ended, both sides were affected negatively where South Korea lost many resources defening their land and both countries still remain divided, and North Korea is still a communist nation.</li>
      <li>Months before the North Korean army crossed the 38th parallel, the CIA noted that North Korean troops were moving south. The CIA, however, did not take any action and viewed the movement as a “defensive measure.”</li>
      <li>The Korean War was never officially more than a “police action” because President Truman never asked Congress for a formal declaration of war.</li>
      <li>During the war, North Korea was supported by the Soviet Union (Russia) and the People’s Republic of China, both communist countries.</li>
      <li>During the Korean War, South Korea was supported by the United States, Great Britain, and the United Nations, which all supported democracy and opposed communism.</li>
      <li>An estimated 86,300 Korean War veterans are women, making up 7% of the estimated number of all female veterans.</li>
