    <h2>Aftermath</h2>
    <h3>Korea's Split</h1>
    <p>After the Korean War, Korea was split into 2 different countries, South Korea, a capitalist country, and North Korea, a communist country. North Korea and South Korea remain split and are still capitalist and communist respectively. Other countries such as Germany were also split before, but Korea is the only country to reamin split throughout hsitory.</p>
    <h3>The Cold War</h1>
    <p>Many people blame the start of the Cold War on the aftermath of the Korean War. During the Korean War there were 2 superpower countries, the United States and the Soviet Union. Because they were on different sides, the U.S. and Soviet Union competed to become the better superpower which later resulted in the Cold War after the development of the Atomic Bomb.</p>
    <h3>Japan</h1>
    <p>Japan was heavily impacted by their loss in the Korean War. Japan had to sign many treaties and was looked down upon. Later, Japan actually benefited from the Korean War even if they lost. Their economy rose and eventually became a world power.</p>
    <h3>The Soviet Union</h1>
    <p>The Soviet Union was highly impacted by the war. Their relationships with China died and lead to the Sino-Soviet split which eventually lead to the fall of the Soviet Union. The defeat wasn't just a break, many countries in the Soviet Union had spent many resources trying to win. Because they spent so much, their economy dropped which lead to very poor countries popping up in east Asia.</p>
    <h3>Korea</h1>
    <p>Korea was completely devastated after the war. Communities were forced to rebuild everything from homes and shops after the war. Korea became one of the poorest countries in the world, even more than the poorest countries now. Many other countries sent money and support to Korea which helped. Korea faced what some call a miracle when they clumbed up the economy becomming one of the most wealthiest countries in less that 100 years! This caused Korea's popularity and culture to be known all across the world.</p>
