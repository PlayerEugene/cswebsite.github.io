    <h2>Main Content</h2>
    <p>The Korean war started when about 75,000 north korean troops crossed the 38th parallel into South Korea to invade on June 25, 1950. The North Koreans were backed up by soviet russia and quickly ran over most of the north of South Korea. By July, U.S> troops had come into South Korea and helped South Korea push back to the 38th parallel where both sides were stopped.</p>
    <p>They spent the rest of the war fighting in the middle and ended in July 1953 where Korea was split into 2.</p>
    <p>In July 1951, South Korea started talking about peace negotiations and agreed on a ceasefire on the 38th parallel. Although there was a ceasefure, both sides did not agree on the prisoners. After 2 years of fighting, they made a decision that Korea would be cut which "created a 2-mile-wide “demilitarized zone” that still exists today." During North Korea's sudden attack, many people were attacked and described it where they "heard gunshots everywhere" and "created fear and destruction everywhere".</p>
